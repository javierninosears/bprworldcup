**Code for BPR World Cup article**
I was motivated to write about a very real atrocity that was happening under the public's eye: Qatar's human rights violations in preparations for the 2022 World Cup. I found it shameful
the image of the world's most beautiful sport was at risk of being tarnished by the deaths of thousands of migrant workers brought on by rampant violation of international labor laws.

But the unfortunate truth is that this World Cup was **not** the first time I remember human rights violations creeping into international sporting events in my lifetime. From the 2018
World Cup to the 2008 Beijing Olympics to the 2014 Sochi Olympics, the sporting world has allowed these violations to continue to occur. I was inspired to analyze the situation, to see if
it was really as bad as it seemed, and to try to find potential solutions.
